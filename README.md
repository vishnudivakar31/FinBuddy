  - **Home Page** is a three tabbed view with options for overview, bill listings and settings. Users can add
    a bill from homepage, it is a global option so it won't be limited by any selected tab.
    - **Overview Tab**: This is the default selected tab for homepage. Here it shows insight of expenses for
      the current month. The pie chart shows the expense distribution by expense category and the page showcases
      top 5 expenses made in the selected time filter.

### Known Bugs:
  - As of now, users are not allowed to update the user information after
    creating the account
  - The date filter is dependent on each tab, date filter selected on overview tab
    doesn't honor in bill list tab and vice-versa.
